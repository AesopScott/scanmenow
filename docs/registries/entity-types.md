# Presidio Entity Type Registry

Every Presidio entity type string used in this project. For each: how it's produced (built-in Presidio recognizer or custom `PatternRecognizer`), where it's consumed (test assertions, `findings.entity_type` column), and status. Update whenever a new recognizer is added or an entity type string is referenced in tests or storage logic.

**Cross-boundary contract:** `findings.entity_type` (SQLite column) stores these strings verbatim. Test assertions compare against them. Custom recognizers must register the exact string that tests assert — a mismatch causes silent misses.

## `EMAIL_ADDRESS`

Standard email address (RFC 5322). Detected by Presidio's built-in `EmailRecognizer`.

## Audit Trail — Proof of Registry Verification

**Last audit:** 2026-05-27T00:00:00Z (by /cross-boundary-audit — Task #9 pre-build plan validation)

**Boundaries checked:** Presidio entity type strings (full code scan — all recognizer modules, __init__, analyzer, tests, plus plan review for Task #9 deliverables)

**Evidence recorded:**
- 9 entries with complete producer/consumer pairs ✓ (`EMAIL_ADDRESS`, `PERSON` — smoke-tested; `MEDICAL_RECORD_NUMBER`, `HEALTH_PLAN_BENEFICIARY`, `ACCOUNT_NUMBER`, `CERTIFICATE_LICENSE_NUMBER`, `VEHICLE_IDENTIFIER`, `DEVICE_IDENTIFIER`, `BIOMETRIC_IDENTIFIER` — Task #3 shipped, 27/27 tests passing)
- 6 entries confirmed native with no bespoke test consumers ✓ (`PHONE_NUMBER`, `US_SSN`, `IP_ADDRESS`, `URL`, `LOCATION`, `DATE_TIME`)
- 8 planned entries ⚠ — Task #9 PII types registered in advance of build: `CREDIT_CARD`, `US_BANK_NUMBER`, `US_PASSPORT`, `US_DRIVER_LICENSE`, `IBAN_CODE`, `CRYPTO`, `MEDICAL_LICENSE`, `NRP`
- New identifiers introduced on Task #9 (planned, not yet built): all 8 PII types above
- Registries match current code diff: ✓ (existing 15 types match code; 8 new types marked planned, no code yet)

**Collision risks documented:**
- `US_DRIVER_LICENSE` ↔ `CERTIFICATE_LICENSE_NUMBER` — both may fire on license number patterns
- `MEDICAL_LICENSE` ↔ `MEDICAL_RECORD_NUMBER` and `CERTIFICATE_LICENSE_NUMBER` — overlap on NPI/license patterns
- `US_BANK_NUMBER` ↔ `ACCOUNT_NUMBER` — overlap on account-like numeric strings

**Gaps identified:** 8 planned entries (Task #9 not yet built) — expected, not a problem

**Status:** ✓ Audit complete (Task #9 pre-build plan validation)

---

**Build-start audit — 2026-05-27T16:00:00Z (by /cross-boundary-audit — pre-code validation, Task #5 branch)**

**Branch:** task/5-group-d-filesystem-walker-integration (cut from main, Task #3 merged)

**Boundaries checked:** All 23 Presidio entity type strings — recognizer modules, `__init__.py`, `analyzer.py`, and all tests

**Evidence recorded:**
- 9 custom entries ✓ — all 7 HIPAA custom types + `EMAIL_ADDRESS` + `PERSON` have complete producer/consumer pairs; `test_hipaa_recognizers.py` 27/27 passing on main
- 6 native entries ✓ — confirmed by Presidio built-in registration; no bespoke test assertions needed
- 8 Task #9 planned entries ⚠ — no code yet; correctly pre-registered
- Task #5 introduces NO new entity types (all entity types produced by `analyze_text()` flow through `findings.entity_type` verbatim — no new type strings needed)
- 0 mismatches on implemented entries; 0 new collision risks introduced by Task #5

**New identifiers Task #5 will introduce:** none — entity type registry unchanged by Task #5

**Status:** ✓ Build-start audit complete (Task #5)

---

## Audit Trail — Task #8 Pre-build Baseline

**Pre-build audit — 2026-05-27T18:00:00Z (by /cross-boundary-audit — Task #8 baseline)**

**Branch:** main (pre-Task #8 code; Task #5 build-started in parallel worktree)

**Boundaries checked:** Presidio entity type strings — all `entity_type` references in `src/` and `tests/`

**Evidence recorded:**
- All 7 HIPAA custom entity types remain in registry and in code (verified: `mrn.py`, `beneficiary.py`, `account.py`, `license.py`, `vehicle.py`, `device.py`, `biometric.py`) ✓
- All 6 Presidio native entity types remain in registry and tested ✓
- 8 PII entity types pre-registered for Task #9 ⚠ — `pii/us_pii.py` does not exist yet; expected
- `findings.entity_type` column (TEXT) stores all strings verbatim — no schema change needed for Task #8 or Task #9 ✓
- Task #8 introduces no new entity types — retention operates on all existing types regardless of label
- 0 entity type strings found in code that are not in the registry
- 0 shape mismatches

**Status:** ✓ Pre-build audit complete (Task #8 baseline) — no changes to entity-types registry
